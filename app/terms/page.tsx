          <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
            <li>
              <strong>Users:</strong> You can use the Platform to request a Ride
              or delivery by specifying your pickup and drop-off locations. You
              will be shown the estimated fare for the Ride before you request
              it. Users can also add package insurance to their parcels. Shride
              insures packages up to 10,000 upon completing the necessary
              documentation and processes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Riders:</strong> You can use the Platform to accept or
              decline Ride requests. You will be able to see the User’s pickup
              and drop-off locations, as well as the estimated fare for the
              Ride, before you accept it.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">6. Fares and Payments</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
            <li>
              Fares are calculated based on factors such as distance, time, and
              demand.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can see the estimated fare for a Ride before you request it
              (users) or accept it (Drivers).
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment for Rides is made through the Platform using your linked
              payment method.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shride may add fees or surcharges to fares from time to time. We
              will notify you of any changes to the fare structure before they
              go into effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              Additional fee is an extra fee required to complete your ride or
              delivery, this is used to cover statutory expenses or parting fee.
              You will be debited if you have enough money in your wallet to
              cover for it. If not, you will receive a notification to fund your
              wallet to continue the trip.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">7. Cancellations</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-10">
            <li>Both Riders and users can cancel Rides before they begin.</li>
            <li>
              There may be cancellation fees associated with cancelling a Ride,
              depending on how far in advance the cancellation occurs.
            </li>
            <li>
              You can see the cancellation policy before you request or accept a
              Ride.
            </li>
            <li>
              Both riders and users can end an ongoing trip. If a user cancels
              an ongoing trip after pickup, the total fee for the trip will be
              credited to the rider. If a rider cancels an ongoing trip, the
              total fee will be put on hold and investigated by Shride’s support
              team, and necessary actions will be taken to pay a percentage of
              the fee, depending on how far into the trip it was before
              cancellation.
            </li>
          </ul>

            Grey Market Transactions: A Violation of Shride's Terms of Service
          </h2>
          <p>
            At Shride, we strive to maintain a safe, reliable, and transparent
            ride-hailing service for both users and drivers. One of the critical
            violations of our terms of service is engaging in grey market
            transactions.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">What are Grey Market Transactions?</h3>
          <p>
            Grey market transactions refer to accepting payments or giving rides
            outside of the Shride app. This practice involves conducting ride
            transactions independently of the platform, thereby bypassing
            Shride’s established systems for payment processing, safety
            monitoring, and customer support.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">Why Are Grey Market Transactions Prohibited?</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal ml-10">
            <li>
              <strong>Security and Safety:</strong> Shride's platform is
              designed to ensure the safety and security of both drivers and
              users. When transactions occur outside the app, this protective
              framework is compromised, increasing the risk of fraud, disputes,
              and unsafe conditions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Transparency:</strong> Our app provides a transparent
              system for calculating fares, applying surge pricing, and
              processing payments. Grey market transactions undermine this
              transparency, potentially leading to unfair pricing and
              dissatisfaction among users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Accountability:</strong> Shride holds drivers and users
              accountable through in-app tracking, ratings, and feedback
              systems. Off-app transactions bypass these accountability
              measures, making it difficult to resolve issues and maintain
              service quality.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Insurance and Coverage:</strong> Rides booked through the
              Shride app are covered by our insurance policies, providing
              protection for both drivers and users. Grey market transactions
              are not covered, leaving both parties vulnerable in case of
              accidents or incidents.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compliance and Legal Obligations:</strong> Conducting
              transactions outside the app can lead to non-compliance with local
              regulations and tax laws, putting both Shride and its users at
              legal risk.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <h3 className="mt-5 text-xl font-semibold">Consequences of Grey Market Transactions:</h3>
          <ul className="list-decimal ml-10">
            <li>
              <strong>Immediate Termination:</strong> Engaging in grey market
              transactions will result in the immediate termination of the
              driver's account and access to the Shride platform.
